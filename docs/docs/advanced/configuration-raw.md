!!! warning
    This section describes raw configuration format accepted by RoomHub firmware. This is usually needed only in development and for very early alpha versions of RoomHub firmware.<br/>
    You should [use RoomHub Configurator](configuration.md#configuration-with-roomhub-configurator) for regular configuration.


[TODO write about direct configuration format]
